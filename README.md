## What is an IDE?

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.

In Market we are having many IDE's like Visual Studio, Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ IDEA, etc. In this repository we will be covering documentation for some of the IDE's. This would contain the basic information about the IDE, how to install it, how to use it, etc.

## What is a text editor?

A text editor is a program that allows you to edit plain text files. It is a simple program that allows you to create, open, edit, and save text files. Text editors are used to create and edit source code, configuration files, and other plain text files.

In Market we are having many text editors like Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom, etc. In this repository we will be covering documentation for some of the text editors. This would contain the basic information about the text editor, how to install it, how to use it, etc.
